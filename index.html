 <p>The <b>Silberian Husky</b>is a medium-sized working dog breed that originated in northeastern siberia,russia.Recognizable by its thickly furred double coat, erect triangular ears,and distinctive markings,huskies were orignally bred as sled dogs by the Chukchi people.They are high-energy dogs with a vivacious and mischievous personality,but can be affectionate and gentle with proper care.</p>
 <p>Huskies are very trainable,but it's tricky to get them to obey every command every time.They tend to weigh up the benefits before doing things.Huskies like to figure out escape routes and test them.if u leave a kitchen window open,they will be at a <B>BBQ </B>miles away with their "new family"before you notice.They will often enter a new area and immediatly check out all edges before they are happy.Huskies are normally good with children so are good family dogs.They are also good with anyone so they make a very bad guard dog,making friends with intruders or just ignoring them completly.Husky fur allow them to cope with a wide range of tempratures. The longer fur helps keep them cool and the combination of longer fur and base coat keeps them warm. </p>
